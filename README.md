This is my submission for project 2 of CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

The requirements for the project 2 are outlined here:
https://docs.cs50.net/web/2018/x/projects/2/project2.html

The Display name has to be defined using a bootstrap4 modal.

You can add unique channels, if you submit an existing channel name this is ignored due to the use of Python sets.
Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.

All messages are stored in a Python dictonary, with a maximum of 100 messages per channel.

When you join a channel the displayed messages are removed and the messages from the selected channel are emitted using the socket id.

The display name and last selected channel are stored locally in the browser.

As a personal touch I have styled the meesages send by the user different from messages sent by other users.
